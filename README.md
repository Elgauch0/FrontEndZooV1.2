# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# ZooV1.2 Frontend

This project is a frontend application built with React and Vite. It leverages Vite's speed and efficiency for development, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth developer experience. It also incorporates ESLint for code quality and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool that serves your code during development and bundles it for production.
- **ESLint:** A linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and preventing bugs.
- **npm:** The Node package manager.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** Version 14 or higher. It's recommended to use a Node version manager like nvm (Node Version Manager) or fnm (Fast Node Manager) for easier management of Node versions.
- **npm (or yarn):** npm version 6 or higher, or yarn if you prefer.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Elgauch0/FrontEndZooV1.2](https://github.com/Elgauch0/FrontEndZooV1.2)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd FrontEndZooV1.2
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or if using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the Vite development server. The application should be accessible at a specified port (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar). Check the console output for the exact URL.
